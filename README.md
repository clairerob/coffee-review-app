# coffee-review-app

A project built loosely from an intro to react native video by NetNinja.
I worked in more recent versions than the tutorial,
and also wanted to practice working with a UI library such as react-native-paper,
so I worked through various issues including learning React Nativation 6
and configuring global themes for the combination of these two libraries.

Next steps will be to work on the UI design, adapt the current setup to coffee,
and consider adding a login layer and backend.
