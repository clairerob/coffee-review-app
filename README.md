# coffee-review-app

A project built from part of an intro to react native video by NetNinja (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ).
I worked in more recent versions than the tutorial which required significant code changes according to the documentation,
and also wanted to practice working with a UI library such as react-native-paper,
so I worked through various issues including learning React Navigation 6
and configuring global themes for the combination of these two libraries.

Next steps will be to work on the UI design, adapt the current setup to coffee,
and consider adding a login layer and backend.
